The download links (please see below) in this repo contain 251,668 HTML files, and there are 1,391 pages that returned 404 status code on request (please check the [http_status_code_404_list](https://github.com/neversaygit/raw-pages-for-Amazon-movie-reviews-dataset/blob/main/http_status_code_404_list.txt) for the productId list of these 404 pages).

## Instructions

You will need at least **250 GB free disk space** to download and decompress the files. Please notice the .7z file is splited into several volumes, and you will need to download all 6 volumes (from *RawDataSet.7z.001* to *RawDataSet.7z.006*) to decompress them via [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

If you are using Win10 system, you might want to temporarily turn off the "Real-time protection" while decompressing as it will dramatically slowdown the decompression process.
